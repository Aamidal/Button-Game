        You are Tavalas, a renowned physician and natural philosopher. You are aboard the horrible old Tranquil Cloud. An accursed rattling is distracting you from your studies. You believe it is coming from a useless machine, and that the button in front of you will stop it.

    <button>Stop machine</button>
